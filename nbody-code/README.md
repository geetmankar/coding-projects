## Python N-Body Simulation

Run the script to see a live plot of an N-Body simulation. Add the `-sv` or `--save_video` option with the script to write a video file using the `cv2` package. Do NOT use the `-ip` or `--ipynb` option as it is still not fixed, hence the script does not show live plots in notebooks properly. Use Python $\geq$ 3.9 to avoid unexpected errors.
